# UNSW-NB15 Dataset Analysis and Classification

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing and applying big data methodologies to the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, a collection of 10 million network traffic records, including both normal behaviors and various cyberattacks. The dataset contains 49 features generated by the **Argus** and **Bro-IDS** tools, and it includes 9 types of attacks: **Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, and Worms**.

We use **Apache Hive** for querying and converting raw data into useful information, and **PySpark** for advanced analytics and classification tasks.

## Project Tasks

### 1. **Big Data Query & Analysis using Apache Hive**

In this task, we use **Apache Hive** to analyze the dataset. The goal is to:
- Understand the dataset by importing it into **Hadoop HDFS** and querying it with Hive.
- Perform at least **4 Hive queries** to extract insights and convert raw data into useful information.
- Present the findings both **numerically and graphically** using appropriate visualization tools.
  
**Subtasks:**
- Import the UNSW-NB15 dataset into Hadoop HDFS.
- Create a Hive table from the dataset.
- Perform queries for data exploration and extraction.
- Visualize and interpret the results.

### 2. **Advanced Analytics using PySpark**

In this section, we will perform advanced analytics using **PySpark** to better understand the dataset and design machine learning classifiers.

#### 2.1 **Analyze and Interpret Big Data**
We will apply at least **four analytical methods** to the dataset, such as:
- **Descriptive statistics**: To summarize the data and understand its distribution.
- **Correlation analysis**: To find relationships between different features.
- **Hypothesis testing**: To determine significant differences between attack types.
- **Density estimation**: To visualize the distribution of the dataset.

Both **numerical** and **graphical** representations will be used, with proper tooltips, legends, titles, and axis labels for clarity.

#### 2.2 **Classifier Design and Implementation**

We will design two classifiers using PySpark's machine learning library (**MLlib**):

- **Binary Classifier**: A model to classify data into **normal** or **attack** categories.
  - The chosen algorithm will be explained, and the model will be evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics.
  - Results will be presented both numerically and graphically.

- **Multi-class Classifier**: A model to classify data into **ten classes** (one normal class and nine attack types).
  - The algorithm, its parameters, and performance will be discussed, along with numerical and graphical interpretations.

## Requirements

- **Apache Hadoop** with HDFS setup
- **Apache Hive** for querying
- **PySpark** for analytics and machine learning tasks
- **Visualization tools** (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for graphical representations

## Usage

1. **Data Import into HDFS**  
   - Place the UNSW-NB15 dataset (CSV format) into Hadoop HDFS:
     ```bash
     hdfs dfs -put /local/path/to/unsw-nb15.csv /hdfs/path
     ```

2. **Hive Table Creation**  
   - Use HiveQL to create a table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE unsw_nb15 ( ... ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;
     LOAD DATA INPATH '/hdfs/path/to/unsw-nb15.csv' INTO TABLE unsw_nb15;
     ```

3. **PySpark Analytics**  
   - Run PySpark scripts to analyze data:
     ```bash
     spark-submit pyspark_analysis.py
     ```

## Outputs

- **Hive Queries**: SQL-like queries to extract key insights.
- **Numerical and Graphical Representations**: Visualizations of findings from Hive queries and PySpark analysis.
- **Binary and Multi-class Classifiers**: Models built using PySpark with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Conclusion

This project provides hands-on experience in handling a large dataset using big data technologies like Hadoop, Hive, and PySpark. It demonstrates how to extract valuable insights from raw data and build effective classifiers to detect network anomalies and attacks.
